# Midnight-Scrapyard

A plugin presenting an epilogue for the Kor Sestor region of Endless Sky.

This region of space has abandoned derelicts waiting to be scavenged. But something lurks amongst the wreckage...

Highlights

- Korath "scrapper" faction
- new invasive life form
- some new missions
- a pet that accompanies your fleet into battle
- two unique boarding weapons
- Korath equivalent of "Marauder" Raiders
- an infestation that threatens to expand beyond the Scrapyard
