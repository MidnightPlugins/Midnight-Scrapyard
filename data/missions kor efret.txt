After waiting for her to finish, you approach her. "These shadow creature attacks have caused some colonists to have second thoughts about settling on planets farther than the Quarg ring. I can't blame them. The ship I was on was also attacked. It was an unnerving experience. The worst part wasn't the attack itself. It was being stranded in space on a derelict with no power without knowing how long it would take for someone to rescue us... or if we'd even be rescued."
